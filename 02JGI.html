    <p class="m-featured-link-listing__text f-body">Remember we had filters from Phase 1? Filters are important when dealing with huge sets of data. However, user feedback  indicated that the filters took up too much room; but when we tucked them under a filter bar, users sometimes missed them.  So half jokingly, we started with a strong visual statement to make sure the filter bar  stood out, a rainbow! From there, we explored 20+ different ways to make the bar visually stand out.

With limited space at the top of the page AND on the sticky header, the team agreed to try what we called a bento-box.
